        This repository contains a set of python games that come with a main menu. I initially made these for a school assesment, but I have decided to add to the repository and develop more custom and advanced games. Once there is enough games, I will catergorize them in the main menu to make it easier to choose what game to play. At the moment, all of the games are text-based only, but grapical games will be added later on this year. Below, you will find out how to set the application up and how to use it. Enjoy!

**For Python Beginners** : This code would be great for python beginners, who are interested in game development, to start somewhere. I have commented all of the code so everyone will be able to understand what each part of the program does and how it all works. If you would like to make any improvements, feel free to contibute to this repo. If there is something you don't understand, my contact details can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/shannon-nz/">GitHub profile</a> or my <a href="http://shan.rf.gd">Profile Website</a>

# How The App Works
In the `config.json` file, you are given a default balance of $100, this is all the money that you are allowed to spend in the game. When you are below $0, you are in debt and will not be able to play anymore. To reset the balance, use the `reset` command. You can also just add unlimited money by changing the `config.json` file and setting the balance to whatever you want (as long as it is a number)

The app will automatically install any module required that are not already installed. These modules are required for the app to function fully. The app will also automatically become full screen, this is done with the keyboard module and using the code:
```
keyboard.press('win+up')
keyboard.release('win+up')
 ```

There are mutliple commands that you can use, some of which are just for the sake of seeing what you can do with python.

<br>

- Option 2 - Terminal - Use the terminal, to run the application.
Windows:
```
